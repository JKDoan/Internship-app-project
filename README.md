# Internship-app-project
Front-end Android app build for my internship.

I worked on developing the front-end for the Android version of an app that currently only exists on iOS. As it was an internship project, I only needed to work on a part of the app. I presented this project to the company I worked at and the school, and managed to pass the semester with it.
